# Time Locker

Time Locker is a Linux utility that allows for you to tinker with your system and have a default fallback. Time Locker creates a copy of the file that you are using. Every time that file is called, Time Locker allows changes to it while the original copy has been kept as a backup. You can, at any point of time, choose to restore your files
